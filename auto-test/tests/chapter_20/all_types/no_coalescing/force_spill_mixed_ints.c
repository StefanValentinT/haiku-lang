/* Test that we can handle spilling correctly.
 * We have to spill one pseudo. The test script will validate that
 * we spill only one and it's the cheapest one.
 * Note that this isn't a foolproof test of spill cost calculation;
 * because of optimistic coloring, we might end up spilling should_spill
 * even if it's not the first spill candidate we select.
 * This test program is generated from templates/chapter_20_templates/force_spill.c.jinja
