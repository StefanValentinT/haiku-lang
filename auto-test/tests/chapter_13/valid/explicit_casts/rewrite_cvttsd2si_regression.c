/* Regression test for rewriting cvttsd2si instructions whose destinations are
 * memory operands. The other test programs for this chapter exercise this
 * rewrite rule until we implement register allocation. But once we implement
 * register allocation, cvttsd2si destination operands in those programs will
 * be allocated to hard registers, not memory.
 *
 * In this program, we include a cvttsd2si whose destination will be spilled
 * during register allocation, so we'll still have test coverage for this
 * rewrite rule when we run the chapter 20 test commands.
 *
 * This test program is generated from templates/pre_ch20_spill_var.c.jinja.
