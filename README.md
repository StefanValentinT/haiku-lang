# My Little Compiler

I guess this language will at some point be called Haiku, but I am still looking for names.

Haiku should be a baeutiful and elegant, expressive language, inspired by:
- simplicity of C
- minimalism of Go
- safety of Rust
- theory from Haskell

Next I will have to write a llvm-backend, which I guess will replace the handwritten assembly gen.
